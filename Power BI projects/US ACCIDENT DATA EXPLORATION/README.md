## US ACCIDENT EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

**Aim: **
- Conducting descriptive analytics on accidents occurence in the US to know the accident hotspots (city, county & states)  and severity levels.
- Running a diagnistic analysis and data exploration to decipher the most contributing factors to accidents in the US
  
Period: 2016- 2023

Visualization Tool: **Power BI**

**KEY INSIGHTs**
- Highest frequency of accidents was recorded in the city Miami in county Los Angeles in the state of California.
- Majority of accidents severity levels were moderate with most happening in day time.
- Lack of crossing & traffic signal are the major factors contributing to approx 89% and 85% respectively of most US accidents.

**RECOMMENDATIONs**
- Crossings and Traffic signals should be installed in the most frequent road accident hotspot locations..
- More Traffic wardens should be deployed to control traffic during busy and peak periods (Days, hours & Months) when there is heavy traffic and influx of drivers on the road.
