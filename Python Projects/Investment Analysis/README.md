**## Investment Data Analysis**

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an investment dataset to uncover trends in investor demographics, preferences, and risk appetites.

📊 **Project Workflow**

Data Overview – Inspect dataset structure

Gender Distribution – Visualization of demographic balance

Descriptive Statistics – Summary of numerical variables

Investment Trends – Exploring preference scores across financial products

Risk Appetite – Studying demographics vs. investment choices

Correlation Study – Analyzing relationships between instruments

Visualization & Insights – Communicating results with plots

⚙️ **Tools & Libraries**

Python, Pandas, NumPy – Data analysis

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis

📈 **Key Insights**

Average investor age: 27.8 years

Gold is the most preferred investment avenue

Debentures and Government Bonds rank higher than Equity or Mutual Funds

PPF is the least attractive option among surveyed investors

Traditional (low-risk) and Market (high-risk) instruments show distinct correlation clusters
